# Overview
This project was created to show earthquake data, tectonic plates loction on the earth, earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.

This map shows earthquakes locations, tectonic plate lines, and the magnitude of the earthquake. This was done from pulling earthquake data from [Earthquake Data](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) and plate tectonic data from [Plate Tectonic Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json). It has two overlays, one for simple street view, and the other for satellite view.  To view the different maps, one can toggle the options in the top right corner.

In addtion to the earthquake data and plate tectonics, the map also highlights the locations of earthquakes with magnitudes over 4.5. These are shown in orange and red.  The data for this addtion was pulled from: [Location](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson) 
To view the different maps, one can toggle the options in the top right corner.

This third map is the same as the one before, but with a dark overlay. It adds another appealing way to view the map.  Again, one just needs to toggle through the different options in the top right corner.
